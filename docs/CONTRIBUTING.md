# Contributing to OS2 governed Project

Welcome to our open-source project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. This guide outlines how you can get involved and make a positive impact. 

## Getting Started

1. **Repository Location** : Our primary code repository resides within an OS2-managed GitHub organization. **Maintainers and Teams** :

* Each repository has a team of maintainers. These maintainers can be vendors or well-trained developers/users.
* A project coordinator oversees issues, milestones, and delegation on GitHub. The availability of project budget determines how these roles are filled.

1. **Documentation** :

* We maintain documentation in a separate repository under the same organization.
* This documentation covers both usage instructions and guidelines for development and contributions.
* Our documentation repository automatically builds a searchable documentation site using GitHub Actions. You can find a simple template for this purpose

1. **Reusable Projects** :

* Our projects are designed to be reusable, well-structured, and compliant with best practices.


## How to Contribute

_We follow the **GitHub Flow** to deliver full transparency and simple collaboration in the development process. **GitHub flow** is a lightweight, branch-based workflow. It‚Äôs not just for developers; it‚Äôs useful for everyone involved in the project._


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an issue
_Issues serve as the starting point for proposing changes or reporting problems_

- Start by checking our issue tracker for similar issues and solutions, before adding a new issue.
 If your solution, feature og task is not allready present in the issue tracker, [create a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) and describe the change in the project you want to address.

- Participate in a conversation via the issue to help shape the potential solution to the issue.

- If the conversation ends with a descission by the project owners and maintainers, that some work should be done, open up a new branch for the changes. This allows you to work on changes without affecting the rest of the project. Link the branch to the issue, to make it easy to understand the rationale behind the work being done in the project.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make Changes

* On your branch, make the desired changes to the repository.
* Commit and push your changes, giving each commit a descriptive message.
* Your branch serves as a safe space for making changes.

1. **Review and Collaborate** :

* Collaborators can review your work on the branch.
* Continue making, committing, and pushing changes until you‚Äôre ready for feedback.

1. **Pull Request (PR)** :

* When you‚Äôre ready, submit a pull request from your branch to the main repository.
* Maintainers will review your work, provide feedback, and merge it into the default branch.

 **Prerequisites** : To follow GitHub flow, you‚Äôll need a GitHub account and a repository. If you haven‚Äôt already, create an account on GitHub. Then, create or find a repository to contribute to.

1. **Fork and Branch** :

* Fork our repository to your own GitHub account.
* Create a new branch for your contribution.

1. **Make Changes** :

* Follow the guidelines provided in the issue description.
* Make your changes, whether it‚Äôs code improvements, bug fixes, or new features.
